# Socket-Programming
A relay-based peer-to-peer file exchange system (using client-server architecture) with TCP socket programming in C. Relay server keeps track of active server nodes that have files. A client connects to the relay server to acquire active server node IPs and then obtains the target file by communicating with server nodes.
